<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p>The Shakespearean Sonnets are not a single or connected work like an
ordinary play or poem. Their composition apparently extended over a
considerable time, which may be fairly estimated as not less than four
years. Read literally they seem to portray thoughts, modes or
experiences fairly assignable to such a period. Though variable and
sometimes light and airy in their movement, the greater portion appear
to reveal deep and intense emotion, the welling and tumultous floods
of the inner life of their great author. And their difficulty or
mystery is, that they indicate circumstances, surroundings,
experiences and regrets that we almost instinctively apprehend could
not have been those of William Shakespeare at the time they were
written, when he must have been in the strength of early manhood, in
the warmth and glow of recent and extraordinary advancement and
success.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 2]</span></p>
<p>It is this difficulty that apparently has caused many to believe that their
  literal meaning cannot be accepted, and that we must give to them, or to many
  of them, a secondary meaning, founded on affectations or conceits relating to
  different topics or persons, or that at least we should not allow that in them
  the poet is speaking of himself. Others, like Grant White, simply allow and
  state the difficulty and leave it without any suggestion of solution.</p>

<p>Before conceding, however, that the splendid poetry contained in the
Sonnets must be sundered or broken, or the apparent reality of its
message doubted or denied, or that its message is mysterious or
inexplicable&mdash;we should carefully inquire whether there is not some
view or theory which will avoid the difficulties which have so baffled
inquiry.</p>

<p>I believe that there is such a view or theory, and that view is&mdash;that
the Sonnets were not written by Shakespeare, but were written to him
as the patron or friend of the poet; that while Shakespeare may have
been the author of some plays produced in his name at the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3]</span>theatre
where he acted, or while he may have had a part in conceiving or
framing the greater plays so produced, there was another, a great
poet, whose dreamy and transforming genius wrought in and for them
that which is imperishable, and so wrought although he was to have no
part in their fame and perhaps but a small financial recompense; and
that it is the loves, griefs, fears, forebodings and sorrows of the
student and recluse, thus circumstanced and confined, that the Sonnets
portray.</p>

<p>Considering that the Sonnets were so written, there is no need of any
other than a literal and natural reading or interpretation. Commencing
in expressions of gratulation and implied flattery, as they proceed,
they appear to have been written as the incidents, fears and griefs
which they indicate from time to time came; and it may well be that
they were written not for publication, but as vents or expressions of
a surcharged heart. With such a view of the situation of the poet and
of his patron, we may not only understand much that otherwise is
inexplicable, but we may understand why so much and such re<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span>splendent poetry is lavished on incidents so bare, meagre, and commonplace, and
why they present both poet and patron with frailties and faults naked
and repellant; and we can the better palliate and forgive the weakness
and subjection which the Sonnets indicate on the part of their author.
With such a reading the Sonnets become a chronicle of the modes and
feelings of their author, resembling in this respect the <i>In Memoriam</i>
of Tennyson; and their poetry becomes deeper and better, often
equalling, if not surpassing in pathos and intensity anything in the
greater Shakespearean plays.</p>

<p>Such is the result or conclusion to which the discussion which follows
is intended to lead. I shall not, however, ask the reader to accept
any such conclusion or result merely because it removes difficulties
or because it makes or rather leaves the poetry better; but I shall
present&mdash;that the Sonnets contain direct testimony, testimony not
leading to surmise or conjecture, but testimony which would authorize
a judgment in a court of law, that the Sonnets were not written by
Shakespeare, and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span>that they very strongly indicate that Shakespeare
was the friend or patron to whom so many of them are addressed.</p>

<p>How such a conclusion from such testimony may be affected by arguments
drawn from other sources I shall not discuss, contenting myself if
into the main and larger controversy I have succeeded in introducing
the effect and teaching of this, certainly, very valuable and
important testimony.</p>

<h2>TESTIMONY OF THE SONNETS AS TO THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE SHAKESPEAREAN PLAYS AND POEMS</h2>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>OF THE CHARACTER OF THE SONNETS AND THEIR RELATION TO THE OTHER WORKS OF THE
  SAME AUTHOR</h3>

<p>In these pages I propose an examination and study of the Shakespearean Sonnets,
  for the purpose of ascertaining what information may be derived from them as
  to the authorship of the Shakespearean plays and poems. I am aware that any
  question or discussion as to their authorship is regarded with objection or
  impatience by very many. But to those not friendly to any such inquiry I would
  say, let us at least proceed so far as to learn precisely what the author of
  these great dramas says of himself and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span>of his work in the only production in
  which he in any manner refers to or speaks of himself. Certainly an inquiry
  confined to such limits is appropriate, at least is not disloyal. And if we
  study the characters of Hamlet, Juliet or Rosalind, do we not owe it to the
  poet whose embodiments or creations they are, that we should study his character
  in the only one of his works in which his own surroundings and attachments,
  loves and fears, griefs and forebodings, appear to be at all indicated?</p>

<p>From the Homeric poems, Mr. Gladstone undertook to gather what they
indicate as to the religion, morals and customs of the time; of the
birthplace of the poet, and of the ethnology and migrations of the
Hellenic peoples. Those poems were not written for any such purpose;
they were for a people who, in the main, on all those subjects knew or
believed as did their author. And it is both curious and instructive
to note how much information as to that distant period Mr. Gladstone
was able to gather from the circumstances, incidents, and implications
of the Homeric poetry. The value of such deductions no one can
question. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 9]</span>We may reject as myths the Trojan War or the wanderings or
personality of Ulysses, but from these poems we certainly learn much
of the method of warfare, navigation, agriculture, and of the social
customs of those times.</p>

<p>So reading these Sonnets, we may perhaps not believe that the grief or
love of the poet or the beauty of his friend was quite as great as the
poetry indicates. But we may fairly take as correct what he says of
his friend or of himself, as to their relations and companionship, the
incidents and descriptions, which were but the framework on which he
wove his poetic wreaths of affection, compliment, or regret.</p>

<p>But before entering on this inquiry, it is quite relevant to ascertain what
  relation these Sonnets bear to the Shakespearean plays and poems. The works
  of Shakespeare, as published, contain thirty-seven separate plays. Most of them
  are of the highest order, and rank with the most consummate products of poetic
  genius. But criticism seems to have established, and critics seem to agree,
  that in the works accredited to him are plays of a lower order, which certainly
  are not from the same <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span>author as the remainder, and especially the greater plays.
  In this widely different and lower class, criticism seems to be agreed in placing
  the greater portion of <i>Pericles</i>, <i>Titus <ins class="correction" title="Original reads 'Adronicus'.">Andronicus</ins></i>, <i>Timon of
  Athens</i>, two parts of <i>Henry VI.</i>, and <i>Henry VIII.</i>[<a href="#f1">1</a><a name="f1_1" id="f1_1"></a>]
  In addition to those, there are at least ten plays not now published as Shakespeare's,
  that are conceded to be of a lower order and by a different author, but which,
  apart from internal evidence, can be almost as certainly shown to be his work
  as many of the greater of the recognized Shakespearean plays. In the same high
  class of poetry as the greater of these dramas are the Sonnets; and they are
  unmistakably, and I think concededly, the work of the author of those greater
  plays.</p>

<p>It is of our poet, as the author of these greater dramas as well as of
the Sonnets, that we would seek to learn in the study of the Sonnets.
It is only in the Sonnets that the poet speaks in the first person, or
allows us any suggestion of himself. His dramas reveal to us the
characters he has imagined and desires to <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span>
portray; but they reveal nothing of the author. His two great poems are dramatic
in substance and equally fail to give us any hint of their creator; but in the
Sonnets his own is the character whose thoughts and emotions are stated. There
we come nearest to him; and there it would seem that we should be able to learn
very much of him. Perhaps we shall find that they do not present him at his best;
it may be that they were intended only for the eye of the friend or patron to
whom they are addressed. Perhaps they reveal the raveled sleeve, the anxieties
of a straitened life and of narrow means. Certainly, while they reveal the wonderful
fertility, resource, and fancy of the poet, they do not indicate that in outward
semblance, surroundings or history their author was either fortunate or happy;
and as we read them, sometimes we may feel that we are entering the poet's heart-home
unbidden and unannounced. But if we have come there when it is all unswept and
ungarnished, may we not the more certainly rely on what it indicates?</p>
<p>Before entering on the study of the Sonnets <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span>we may inquire what, if anything,
  there is, distinctive of our great poet, the recognition of which may aid us
  in their interpretation.</p>

<p>Taine says that "the <i>creative</i> power is the poet's greatest gift, and
  communicates an extraordinary significance to his words"; and further, that
  "he had the prodigious faculty of seeing in a twinkling of an eye a complete
  character."[<a href="#f2">2</a><a name="f2_2" id="f2_2"></a>]</p>

<p>The poet does not bring those characters to us by description, but he
causes them to speak in words so true and apposite to the character he
conceives that we seem to know the individuals from what they say and
not from what the poet wrote or said. But the poet goes much farther,
and in all his works presents surroundings and accessories, impalpable
but certain, which fit the characters and their moods and actions. The
picture of morning in <i>Venus and Adonis</i> is apposite to the rich,
sensuous and brilliant colorings of the queen of love; the reference
in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> to the song of the nightingale "on yond'
pomegranate tree" is but an incident to the soft, warm and
love-<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span>
inviting night; Rosalind moves and talks to the quickstep of the forest; in <i>Macbeth</i>
the incantation of the witches is but the outward expression of an overmastering
fate, whose presence is felt throughout the play. Let us then, in studying the
Sonnets, consider that they are from the same great master as the dramas. And
we shall be thus prepared, where the meaning seems plain and obvious, to believe
that the writer meant what he said, and to reject any interpretation which implies
that when he came to speak of himself he said what he did not mean, or filled
the picture with descriptions, situations or emotions, incongruous or inappropriate.
And if in so reading they seem clear and connected, fanciful and far-drawn interpretations
will not be adopted. We should not distort or modify their meaning in order to
infer that they are imitations of Petrarch, or that the genius of the poet, cribbed
and confined by the fashion of the time, forgot to soar, and limped and waddled
in the footsteps of the inconspicuous sonneteers of the Elizabethan era.</p>
<p>I would illustrate my meaning. Sonnet <span class='pagenum'><a name="page_14" id="page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
CXXVI.
  is sometimes said to be an invocation to Cupid.[<a href="#f3">3</a><a name="f3_3" id="f3_3"></a>] That seems
  to me to destroy all its grace and beauty. The first two lines of the Sonnet,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<p>are quite appropriate, if addressed to the god of love. But the lines
succeeding are quite the reverse. In effect they say that you have not
grown old because Nature, idealized as an active personality, has
temporarily vanquished Time, but will soon obtain the full audit. If
the Sonnet is addressed to the god of love it reduces him to the
limitations of mortality; if it is addressed to his friend, it
indicates that, though but for a little while, Nature has lifted him
to an attribute of immortality. The latter interpretation makes the
poet enlarge and glorify his subject; the former makes him belittle
it, and bring the god of love to the audit of age and the ravage of
wrinkles. This is the last sonnet of the first series; with the next
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span>begins the series relating to his mistress. Reading it literally,
considering it as addressed to his friend, it is sparkling and poetic,
a final word, loving, admonitory, in perfect line and keeping with the
central thought of all that came before. From this Sonnet, interpreted
as I indicate, I shall try to find assistance in this study. But if it
is a mere poetical ascription to Cupid, it, of course, tells us
nothing except that its author was a poet.</p>

<p>I should not, however, leave this subject without stating that the fanciful
  interpretation of these Sonnets does not seem to be favored by more recent authors.
  I find no indication of such an interpretation in Taine's <i>English Literature</i>,
  or in Grant White's edition of Shakespeare. Professor Edward Dowden, universally
  recognized as a fair and competent critic, says: "The natural sense, I am convinced,
  is the true one."[<a href="#f4">4</a><a name="f4_4" id="f4_4"></a>] Hallam says: "No one can doubt that they
  express not only real but intense emotions of the heart."[<a href="#f5">5</a><a name="f5_5" id="f5_5"></a>]
  Professor Tyler, in a work relating to the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]</span>
Sonnets, says: "The impress of reality is stamped on these Sonnets with unmistakable
clearness."[<a href="#f6">6</a><a name="f6_6" id="f6_6"></a>] Mr. Lee, while regarding some of these as mere
fancies, obviously finds that many of them treated of facts.[<a href="#f7">7</a><a name="f7_7" id="f7_7"></a>]
Mr. Dowden, in a work devoted to the Sonnets, states very fully the views which
have been expressed by different authors in relation to them. His quotations occupy
sixty pages and, I think, clearly show that the weight of authority is decidedly
in favor of allowing them their natural or primary meaning.</p>
<p>There are one hundred and fifty-four of these Sonnets. The last two are different
  in theme and effect from those which go before, and may perhaps not improperly
  be considered as mere exercises in poetizing. They have no connection with the
  others, and I would have no contention with those who regard them as suggested
  by Petrarch, or as complaisant imitations of the vogue or fashion of that time.
  Those two Sonnets I leave out of this discussion, and would have what may be
  here said, <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 17]</span>understood as applying only to the one hundred and fifty-two remaining.</p>

<p>These one hundred and fifty-two Sonnets I will now insist have a
common theme. Most of them may be placed in groups which seem to be
connected and somewhat interdependent. Those groups may perhaps, in
some cases, be placed in different orders, without seriously affecting
the whole. To that extent they are disconnected. But in whatever order
those groups are placed, through them runs the same theme&mdash;the
relations of the poet to his friend or patron, and to his mistress,
the mistress of his carnal love, who is introduced only because the
poet fears that she has transferred her affections or favors to his
friend, wounding and wronging him in his love or desire for each.</p>

<p>It is easy to pick out many Sonnets which may be read as disconnected
and independent poetry. But very many more verses could be selected
from <i>In Memoriam</i> that can be read independently of the remainder of
that poem. And there are none of the Sonnets, however they may read
standing alone, that do not fit the mode and movement of those with
which <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]</span>they stand connected. There is, I submit, no more reason for
sundering Sonnets of that class from the others, than there is for
taking the soliloquy of Hamlet from the play that bears his name.</p>

<p>This statement of the theme and the connected character of the Sonnets
is not essential to the views I shall present. Nevertheless, if it is
accepted, if we are able to agree that they all are relevant and
apposite to a common theme, it strengthens the proposition that we
should seek for them a literal meaning and should reject any
construction which would make any of their description or movement
incongruous to any other part. Of course we shall expect to find in
them the enlargement or exaggeration of poetic license. But so doing
we must recall the characteristics of their great author, who with all
exaggeration preserves harmony and symmetry of parts, and harmony and
correspondence in all settings and surroundings. With such views of
what is fair and helpful in interpretation, I propose to proceed to a
closer view of the first one hundred and fifty-two of what are known
as the Sonnets of Shakespeare.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>OF THE AGE OF THE WRITER OF THE SONNETS</h3>

<p>Adopting the views which fix the later period as the date of the Sonnets, it
  seems practically certain that they were written as early as 1598,&mdash;though
  some of them may have been written as late as 1601,&mdash;and that a great portion
  were probably written as early as 1594.[<a href="#f8">8</a><a name="f8_8" id="f8_8"></a>] Shakespeare was
  born in 1564. Consequently they appear to have been written when he was about
  thirty or thirty-four, certainly not over thirty-seven years of age.</p>

<p><i>It will be the main purpose of this chapter to call attention to
portions of the Sonnets which seem to indicate that they were written
by a man well past middle age,&mdash;perhaps fifty or sixty years old, and
certainly not under forty years of age.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]</span>But before proceeding to the inquiry as to the age of the writer, I
invite attention to what they indicate as to the age of the patron or
friend to whom the first one hundred and twenty-six seem to have been
written. In poetry as in perspective, there is much that is relative,
and in the Sonnets the age of the writer and that of his friend are so
often contrasted, that if with reasonable certainty, and within
reasonable limits, we are able to state the age of his friend, we
shall be well advanced toward fixing the age of the writer.</p>

<p>The first seventeen of these Sonnets are important in this connection.
They have a common theme: it is that his friend is so fair, so
incomparable, that he owes it to the world, to the poet, whose words
of praise otherwise will not be believed, that he shall marry and
beget a son. The whole argument clearly implies that the writer deems
such admonition necessary, because his friend has passed the age when
marriage is most frequent, and is verging toward the period of life
when marriage is less probable. His friend appears to the writer as
making a famine where abun<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span>dance lies; he tells him that he beguiles
the world, unblesses some mother; that he is his mother's glass and
calls back the April of her prime; asks him why he abuses the
bounteous largess given him to give; calls him a profitless usurer;
tells him that the hours that have made him fair will unfair him; that
he should not let winter's rugged hand deface ere he has begotten a
child, though it were a greater happiness should he beget ten. He asks
if his failure to marry is because he might wet a widow's eye, and
then in successive Sonnets cries shame on his friend for being so
improvident. He tells him that when he shall wane, change toward age,
he should have a child to perpetuate his youth; and the thought again
brings to the poet the vision of winter, summer's green borne on
winter's bier, and he urges him that he should prepare against his
coming end, by transmitting his semblance to another; that he should
not let so fair a house fall to decay, but should uphold it against
the stormy blasts of winter by begetting a son; seeing in his friend
so much of beauty, he prognosticates that his friend's end is
beauty's <span class='pagenum'><a name="page_22" id="page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>doom and date. Noting that nothing in nature can hold its
perfection long, he sees his friend, most rich in youth, but Time
debating with decay, striving to change his day to night, and urges
him to make war upon the tyrant Time by wedding a maiden who shall
bear him living flowers more like him than any painted counterfeit. He
tells him that could he adequately portray his beauty, the world would
make him a liar, and then closes this theme by saying:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But were some child of yours alive that time,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You should live twice in it, and in my rhyme.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any impression as to the age of the poet's friend which this brief synopsis
  of the first seventeen Sonnets conveys, I think will be increased by reading
  the Sonnets themselves. I have refrained from stating any portions of Sonnets
  II. and VII., desiring to present to the reader their exact words. Sonnet VII.
  reads as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lo! in the orient when the gracious light</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lifts up his burning head, each under eye</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Serving with looks his sacred majesty;</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">And having <i>climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Resembling strong youth in his middle age</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Attending on his golden pilgrimage;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From his low tract, and look another way:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The poet sees his friend, as is the sun after it has climbed the
morning steep and is journeying on the level heaven toward the zenith.
Certainly that must indicate that his friend was advanced toward the
middle arch of life.</p>

<p>Sonnet II. reads as follows:</p>

<p> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">When <i>forty</i> winters shall besiege thy
  brow</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then, being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.</span><br />
<span class="letter"><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>. . . . .</strong></span></span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">This were to be new made when thou art old,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it
  cold.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span></p>
<p>These lines indicate that his friend had not yet reached forty years. And equally
  do they indicate that in the mind of the poet the fortieth year was not in the
  ascending scale of life, but was at, or perhaps beyond, the "highmost pitch"
  toward which, in the seventh Sonnet, he described his friend as approaching.[<a href="#f9">9</a><a name="f9_9" id="f9_9"></a>]</p>

<p>Taking these seventeen Sonnets together, reading and re-reading them,
can we suppose that they were composed by the great delineator, of or
toward a person under or much below thirty? They imply that the person
addressed was not so far below middle life that a statement of the
decadence that would come after his fortieth year presented a remote
or far-off picture. Besides, if his friend was below thirty years,
while it might be well to urge him to marry, hardly would the poet
have used language implying that his marrying days were <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span>waning. To
put it roughly, there would not be so much of the now-or-never thought
running through the ornate verse in which the poet voices his appeal.</p>

<p>As we read these seventeen Sonnets, we may perhaps suspect that the
desire that his friend shall marry is so strongly stated and
presented, because it is a theme around which the poet can
appropriately weave so much of compliment and expressions of
admiration and affection. But if that be so, must we not still believe
that the great dramatist could not have addressed them to his friend,
unless in substance and in all their more delicate shades of meaning
and of coloring they were appropriate to him?</p>

<p>We may now pass from this first group to other Sonnets which convey
similar and, I submit, unmistakable intimations as to the age of the
poet's friend or patron.</p>

<p>Sonnet C., especially when read with the one preceding, clearly
indicates that it was written as a greeting or salutation after
absence, and on the poet's return to his friend. In it he says:</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_26" id="page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>If Time have any wrinkle graven there;</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>If any, be a satire to decay</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And make <i>Time's spoils</i> despised everywhere.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Give my love fame faster <i>than Time wastes life</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Closely following, in Sonnet CIV., the poet says:</p>
<p> <span style="margin-left: 2em;">To me, fair friend, <i>you never can be old</i>,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">For as you were when first your eye I eyed,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold,[<a href="#f10">10</a><a name="f10_10" id="f10_10"></a>]</span><br />
  <span class="letter"><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>. . . . .</strong></span></span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">In process of the seasons have I seen,</span><br />
  <span class="letter"><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>. . . . .</strong></span></span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Steal from his figure, and no pace perceived;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hath motion, and mine eye may be deceived[<a href="#f11">11</a><a name="f11_11" id="f11_11"></a>]:</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 27]</span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The thought is: your beauty may be passing; it may be that my eye that
sees it not, is deceived. We should carefully note the words, "Three
winters cold," "Since first I saw you fresh, which <i>yet</i> are green."
Though they present no clear or sharp indication as to the age of his
friend, yet I think that of them this may be fairly said: the word
"green" is used as opposed to ripe or matured, and his friend's age is
such that three years seem to the poet to have carried him a step
toward maturity. And so reading these words, they harmonize with the
expression of the poet's fear that his great love for his friend may
have prevented him from seeing his beauty</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">like a dial hand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Steal from his figure.</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Sonnet LXX. the poet says of his friend:</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page_28" id="page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou hast pass'd by <i>the ambush of young days</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Either not assail'd, or victor being charged.</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Sonnet LXXVII. the poet says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Time's thievish progress to eternity.</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sonnet CXXVI. is as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dost <i>hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy <i>lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As thou goest onwards, <i>still</i> will pluck thee back,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">May <i>time disgrace</i> and wretched <i>minutes</i> kill.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She may <i>detain</i>, but not <i>still</i> keep, her treasure:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And her quietus is to render thee.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is the last Sonnet which the poet addresses to his friend. Except the
  last two, all that follow are of his mistress, and are of the same theme as
  Sonnets XL., XLI., and XLII., and, we may fairly infer, are of the same date.
  If so, Sonnet CXXVI. is practically the very latest of the entire series, and
  we may deem it a leave-taking, perhaps not of his friend, but of the labor that
  had so long moved him. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]</span>Perhaps for that reason its words should be deemed more
  significant, and it should be read and considered more carefully.[<a href="#f12">12</a><a name="f12_12" id="f12_12"></a>]
  All its thoughts seem responsive to the central suggestion that his friend appears
  much younger than he is. To the poet he seems still a boy because he has so
  held the youth and freshness of boyhood that it is not inappropriate to say
  that he holds in his power the glass of Time; Nature has plucked him back to
  show her triumph over Time, but she cannot continue to do so, but will require
  of him full audit for all his years.</p>

<p>For what age do such expressions seem natural as words of compliment; and when
  first would it have pleased us to be told that we looked younger than we were,
  and to one that loved us, still seemed but as a boy? Hardly much before thirty;
  till then we took but little account of years and would have preferred to be
  told that we seemed manlier rather than younger than we were. But on this let
  us further consult our poet. He tells us that at <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]</span>ten begins the age of the whining
  school-boy; at twenty of the lover, sighing like a furnace, and that of the
  soldier, a vocation of manhood, at thirty.[<a href="#f13">13</a><a name="f13_13" id="f13_13"></a>] To me it seems
  very clear that the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]</span>rich poetic fancy of this Sonnet would be greatly lessened
  by assuming it to be addressed to a person below twenty-five years of age, and
  if it came, as may hereafter appear, from a person of fifty years or over, its
  caressing compliments and admonition would seem quite appropriate for one who
  had reached the fourth age of life. The indication of the last four Sonnets,
  to which I have referred, I submit, is in entire accord with that of the first
  group of seventeen.</p>

<p>I would not, however, leave this branch of the discussion without
indicating what I deem is the fair inference or result from it. I do
not claim that the age of the poet's friend can be certainly stated
from anything contained in the Sonnets. It seems to me, however, that
it mars the poetry and makes its notes seem inappropriate and
discordant, to suppose that the poet had in mind a person below
twenty-five years of age. To do so would make some, at least, of his
terms of description inapt, subtract from the sparkle and force of his
compliments, and cause his words of loving admonition and advice to
appear ill-timed and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span>inappropriate. Certainly the Sonnets indicate
that his friend was on the morning side of life and below forty; and
perhaps ten or twelve years below would best fit the verse. It may be,
probably it is the fact, that a number of years, from four to seven,
elapsed between the earliest and the latest of these Sonnets; and that
may explain why we are not able to find any more specific indications
as to the age of his friend.</p>

<p>There are also Sonnets from which it has been inferred that the poet's
friend was much younger than thirty, and possibly or probably below
twenty years of age. A careful examination of these Sonnets will,
however, I think very clearly indicate that no such inference can be
fairly drawn.</p>

<p>In Sonnet LIV. the poet says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Sonnet XCVI. he says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some say, thy fault is youth, some wantonness;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some say, thy grace is youth and gentle sport;</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]</span></p>
<p>Similar expressions appear in Sonnets II., XV., XXXIII., and XLI.</p>

<p>In Sonnet CXIV. he says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sonnet CXXVI., containing the appellation, "my lovely boy," has been already
  quoted.[<a href="#f14">14</a><a name="f14_14" id="f14_14"></a>]</p>

<p>In Sonnet CVIII. he says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What's in the brain, that ink may character,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What's new to speak, what new to register,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That may express my love, or thy dear merit?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nothing, <i>sweet boy</i>; but yet, like prayers divine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I must each day say o'er the very same;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Even as when first I hallowed thy fair name.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So that eternal love in love's fresh case</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Weighs not the dust and injury of age,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>But makes antiquity for aye his page</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Finding the <i>first</i> conceit of love there bred,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where <i>time</i> and <i>outward form</i> would show it dead.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Hardly could any argument for extreme youth be made from any of these
lines, except as based on the term "boy." The term <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span>"youth" obviously
has a broader significance, and by no strained construction,
especially if coming from a man of advanced years, may be applied to
persons on the morning side of life without any precise or clear
reference to, or indication of, their age. We should therefore turn to
the lines containing the appellation "boy" for whatever of force there
is in the claim for the extreme youth of the poet's friend. Doing so,
the context in each case clearly indicates that no such inference can
be fairly drawn. In the Sonnet last quoted (CVIII.), the poet, saying
that there is nothing new to register of his love for his friend, and
that he counts nothing old that is so used, then says that his eternal
love</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Weighs not the dust and injury of age,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Hardly could he have said plainer that his loving appellation, "sweet
boy," is made because he can allow neither his friend, nor his love
for him, nor his own frequent recurring expressions of it, to grow
old; the last two lines of the Sonnet, referring to the indications
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]</span>of time and outward form, seem to be a continuance and enlargement of
the same thought.</p>

<p>So interpreting his verse it is fresh, sparkling, and complimentary;
but deeming that the person addressed was sixteen or twenty years old,
indeed a mere boy, at least half of the portion of the Sonnet
following the term "sweet boy" is inappropriate and useless. This
Sonnet, I think, might be cited as indicating that, except to the eye
of love, that is in sober fact, the poet's friend was no longer a boy.</p>

<p>Sonnet CXXVI., is quoted at <a href="#page_28">page 28</a>, and discussed,
  and presented as clearly stating that his friend was termed a boy only because,
  as to him, Time had been hindered and delayed.</p>

<p>There is, however, a further consideration which I think should effectually
  dispose of any doubts that may remain on account of the use of the words "youth"
  or "boy." In the succeeding portions of this chapter I shall quote Sonnets indicating,
  indeed saying, that the poet was on the sunset side of life&mdash;probably fifty
  years of age or older, and so at least twenty years older than is indicated
  of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]</span>his friend, except in the Sonnets now being considered. If the poet was fifty
  years of age or more, the terms here discussed are amply and fully satisfied
  without ascribing to them any definite indication as to the age of the person
  addressed. To a person of the age of fifty or sixty years, addressing a person
  young enough to be his son, especially if of a fair and youthful appearance,
  the expressions "boy" or "youth" come quite naturally and have no necessary
  significance beyond indicating the <i>relative</i> age of the person so addressed.[<a href="#f15">15</a><a name="f15_15" id="f15_15"></a>]
  And especially is this so when the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]</span>words are used in expressions of affection
  and of familiar or caressing endearment.</p>

<p>With such aid as may be had from considering the age of his friend, we
come to the more important inquiry: <span class="smcap">What was the age of the author of
these Sonnets,&mdash;what was the age of the poet of the Shakespearean
plays?</span> I shall present that which indicates that <span class="smcap">he was probably
fifty, perhaps sixty, certainly more than forty years of age</span> at the time
he wrote the Sonnets.</p>

<p>But if our great poet was forty,&mdash;probably if he was thirty-five years
  of age, when these Sonnets were composed,&mdash;he was born before 1564, before
  the birth date of William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>The poet clearly indicates that he is older than his friend. In Sonnet XXII.
  he says:</p>
<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>My glass shall not persuade me I am old</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So long as <i>youth and thou</i> are of one date;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But when in thee time's furrows I behold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then look I death my days should expiate.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For all that beauty that doth cover thee</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]</span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">How can I then be <i>elder</i> than thou art?</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Sonnet LXXIII. he speaks directly of his own age or period of life,
as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That <i>time of year</i> thou mayst in me behold</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In <i>me</i> thou seest the <i>twilight</i> of such day</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As <i>after sunset</i> fadeth in the west;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which by and by black night doth take away,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In me <i>thou see'st the glowing of such fire,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That on the ashes of his youth doth lie</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As the death-bed whereon it must expire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To <i>love that well which thou must leave ere long</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The latter part of Sonnet LXII. and Sonnet LXIII. are as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But when my glass shows me myself indeed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Self so self-loving were iniquity.</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]</span><span style="margin-left: 3em;">'T is thee, myself, that for myself I praise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Painting <i>my age with</i> beauty of thy days.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against my love shall be, <i>as I am now</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'erworn;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>With lines and wrinkles</i>; when his youthful morn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hath travell'd on to <i>age's steepy night</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all those beauties whereof now he's king</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stealing away the treasure of his spring;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For such a time do I now fortify</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Against confounding age's cruel knife,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That he shall never cut from memory</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And they shall live, and he in them still green.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>It should be noted that the poet is picturing no morning cloud or storm or
  eclipse; but his grief is that he has had his morning and his noon and that
  he is now at "age's steepy night" <i>because his sun has travelled so far in
  his life's course</i>. The Sonnet seems to be the antithesis of Sonnet VII.,
  quoted at <a href="#page_22">page 22</a>. The metaphor is the same, comparing
  life to the daily journey of the sun. In each, the poet views the <i>steep</i>
  of the journey, the earlier <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]</span>
and the later hours of the day; and while he finds that his friend's age is
  represented by the sun passing from the "steep-up" hill to the zenith, with
  equal clearness and certainty he indicates that his age is represented by its
  last and declining course, that <i>he</i> has "travelled on to <i>age's steepy
  night</i>." As clearly as words can say, the poet states that he is on the sunset
  side of life and indicates that he is well advanced toward its close.</p>

<p>Sonnet CXXXVIII. is as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When my love swears that she is made of truth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I do believe her, <i>though I know she lies</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That she might think me some untutor'd youth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thus <i>vainly</i> thinking that she thinks me young,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Although she knows my days are past the best</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Simply I credit her false-speaking tongue:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And wherefore say not I that I am old?</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And <i>age in love loves not to have years told</i>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Therefore I lie with her and she with me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The poet is here speaking of his mistress, the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]</span>mistress of his carnal
love, who had in act her bed-vow broke (Sonnet CLII.). Having stated
that when she swears she is true he knows she lies, he adopts the
conceit of asserting that he is not old, as an equivalent to her
obvious falsehood in saying that she is not unjust. This is one of
twenty-six Sonnets relating to his mistress and her desertion of him
for his friend. In Sonnets XL., XLI., and XLII. he complains to his
friend of the same wrong.</p>

<p>The fact that the poet found a subject for his verse in such an
occurrence has been much commented on. Poetic fancy would hardly have
chosen such a theme, and these Sonnets seem to be certainly based on
an actual occurrence. And if so, certainly we may construe them very
literally; and read literally they certainly appear to be an old man's
lament at having been superseded by a younger though much loved rival.</p>

<p>William Shakespeare was a prosperous, a very successful man. In twenty years
  he accumulated property which made him a rich man,&mdash;yielding a yearly income
  of $5000, equivalent to $25,000 dollars at the present <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]</span>time. He was an actor
  publicly accredited as a man of amorous gallantries[<a href="#f16">16</a><a name="f16_16" id="f16_16"></a>];
  he married at eighteen, apparently in haste, and less than six months before
  the birth of a child.[<a href="#f17">17</a><a name="f17_17" id="f17_17"></a>] We know from legal records that
  he and his father before him had frequent lawsuits.[<a href="#f18">18</a><a name="f18_18" id="f18_18"></a>] While
  a uniform tradition represents him as comely, pleasing and attractive, equally
  does it represent him as a man of ready, aggressive and caustic wit, and rebellious
  and bitter against opposition.[<a href="#f19">19</a><a name="f19_19" id="f19_19"></a>] The lines on the slab
  over his grave are less supplicatory than mandatory against the removal of his
  bones to the adjacent charnel-house.[<a href="#f20">20</a><a name="f20_20" id="f20_20"></a>] His name, often
  written with a hyphen, indicates that he came of English fighting stock. When
  the Sonnets were written he was in the full tide of success. It is not credible
  that such a man at thirty or thirty-five, of buoyant and abounding life, could
  have so bewailed the loss of a mistress.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee says that the Sonnets last quoted <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]</span>admit of no literal interpretation.[<a href="#f21">21</a><a name="f21_21" id="f21_21"></a>]
  In other words, as I understand, he concedes that a literal interpretation is
  destructive of what he assumes to be the fact as to the authorship of the Shakespearean
  plays. By what right or rule of construction does he refuse them their literal
  reading? They indicate no hidden or double meaning, but seem direct though poetic
  statements of conditions and resulting reflections and feelings. And more than
  that, though appearing in separate groups, their indications as to age all harmonize,
  and are not in conflict with any other part or indication of the Sonnets. Mr.
  Lee urges that these Sonnets were mere affectations, conceits common to the
  poets of that day. That view will not bear investigation. He cites passages
  from poets of that time ascribing to themselves in youth the ills, the miseries,
  the wrinkles, the white hairs of age. But such is not the effect of what has
  been here quoted. The poet says that it is <i>his age</i> that oppresses him,
  and brings him its ills and marks and ravages; and about as clearly as poetic
  description is capable of, indicates <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 44]</span>and says that he is on the sunset side
  of his day of life. I cannot at this instant quote, but I am impressed that
  in the plays of the great poet, the instances are frequent where sorrow or despair
  bring his youthful characters to picture their lot with the deprivations, the
  ills or forebodings of age. But in no such passages is language used which is
  at all equivalent to that here quoted. Nowhere does he present such a travesty
  as to allow Juliet to describe herself in good straight terms that would befit
  her grandmother; and there is nothing that the much-lamenting Hamlet says which
  would lead an actor to play the part with the accessories of age and feebleness
  with which they represent Polonius.</p>

<p>Having now called attention to these Sonnets which give direct indications
  as to the age of the poet, I ask the reader to consider again those which I
  have quoted in relation to the age of his friend, and particularly Sonnets II.
  and VII. (pp. <a href="#page_22">22</a> and <a href="#Page_23">23</a>). If those Sonnets came from a poet of the age and infirmities
  which a literal reading indicates, how forceful, strong, and poetic is their
  appeal. But if it <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 45]</span>is to be assumed that they were written by a man of thirty
  or thirty-five, strong, vigorous, aggressive, fortunate, and successful, the
  appeal seems out of harmony, and lacks that delicate adaptation of speech to
  surroundings which is characteristic of the author.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>I would next call attention to portions of these Sonnets which I do
not present as of themselves having any clearly determinate weight as
to the age of the poet, but which do have great significance from
their correspondence in tone and effect with what has been already
quoted. The poet repeatedly falls into meditations or fancies which
seem more natural to a person on the descending than on the ascending
side of life.</p>

<p>In Sonnets XXX. and XXXI. he says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When to the sessions of sweet silent thought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I summon up <i>remembrance of things past</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And with old woes <i>new wail my dear time's waste:</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For <i>precious friends hid in death's dateless night</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And weep afresh love's <i>long since</i> cancell'd woe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 46]</span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which I new pay, as if not paid before.</span><br />
<span class="letter"><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>. . . . .</strong></span></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">  Thy bosom is endeared with <i>all hearts</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which I <i>by lacking have supposed dead</i>;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And there reigns love, and all love's loving parts,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And all those <i>friends which I thought buried</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How many <i>a holy and obsequious tear</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hath dear, religious love stol'n from mine eye,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As <i>interest of the dead</i>, which now appear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But things removed that hidden in thee lie!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou art the grave <i>where buried love doth live</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hung with the <i>trophies of my lovers gone</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who all their parts of me to thee did give:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That due of many now is thine alone:</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Sonnet LXXI. he says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No longer <i>mourn for me when I am dead</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Give warning to the world <i>that I am fled</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nay, if you read this line, remember not</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The hand that writ it; for I love you so,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If thinking on me then should make you woe.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Sonnet CXXII. he says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain</span><br />
 <span class="letter"><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><strong>. . . . .</strong></span></span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 47]</span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beyond all date, even to eternity:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or, at the least, <i>so long as brain and heart</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have faculty by nature to subsist;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till each to razed oblivion yield his part.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Sonnet CXLVI. he says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">. . . these rebel powers that thee array,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why so large cost, having <i>so short</i> a lease,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And let that pine to aggravate thy store;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Within be fed, without be rich no more:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In Sonnets LXVI. and LXXIV. appear further similar meditations. Such
thoughts and meditations do not seem to be those of the successful and
prosperous man of thirty or thirty-five.</p>

<p>The persuasive force of the Sonnets which have been quoted or referred
to in this chapter <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 48]</span>is much increased by reading or considering them
together. To illustrate: four Sonnets have been quoted containing
direct statements by the poet that he was in the afternoon of life. It
needs no argument to establish that this concurrence of statements
made in different groups of Sonnets and doubtless at different times
has much more than four times the persuasive force of one such
statement. And in like ratio do the other Sonnets indicating the
reflections and conditions of age, increase the weight of the
statements in these four Sonnets. Taking them all together they seem
to present the statements, conditions, and reflections of a man
certainly past the noon of life,&mdash;past forty years of age, and so
older than was Shakespeare at the time of their composition.</p>

<p>If this conclusion is correct, it does not aid, but about equally
repels the claim that Bacon was the author of the Sonnets, or of the
plays or poems produced by the same poet. Bacon was born in 1561, and
was therefore but three years older than Shakespeare.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And one man in his time plays many parts,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then the whining school-boy, with his satchel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And shining morning face, creeping like snail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seeking the bubble reputation</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In fair round belly with good capon lined,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Full of wise saws and modern instances;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That ends this strange eventful history,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is second childishness and mere oblivion,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing."</span><br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Octavius C&aelig;sar at thirty-two is described by Mark Antony after
the battle of Actium as the 'boy C&aelig;sar' who 'wears the rose of

his <i>Astrophel</i> apostrophizes Sir Philip Sidney on his death near
the close of his thirty-second year as 'oh wretched boy' (l. 133)

<p>I was at a public dinner given some years ago, at which General Henry
W. Slocum and Colonel Fred Grant were both speakers. In his remarks,
the General, having stated that his friend the Colonel spoke to him
about being a candidate for an office, continued, "I said to him,
'Why, Fred, you are a mere boy,' and his answer to me was, 'Why,
General, I am as old as my father was when he took Vicksburg.'"
General Grant was then forty years old.</p>

<h3>OF THE DIRECT TESTIMONY OF THE SONNETS AS TO WHO WAS NOT THEIR AUTHOR</h3>

<p>Sonnets LV. and LXXXI. are as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not marble, nor the gilded monuments</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But <i>you</i> shall shine more bright in these contents</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When wasteful war shall statues overturn,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And broils root out the work of masonry,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The living record of <i>your memory</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall <i>you</i> pace forth; your praise shall still find room</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Even in the eyes of all posterity</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That wear this world out to the ending doom.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So, till the judgment that yourself arise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>You</i> live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or I shall live your epitaph to make,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From hence <i>your</i> memory death cannot take,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Although in <i>me</i> each part will be forgotten.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Your</i> name from hence immortal life shall have,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 50]</span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though I, once gone, <i>to all the world must die</i>:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The earth can yield <i>me</i> but a common grave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When <i>you</i> entombed in men's eyes shall lie.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Your monument</i> shall be <i>my gentle verse</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And tongues to be <i>your</i> being shall rehearse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When all the breathers of this world are dead;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;"><i>You</i> still shall live&mdash;such virtue hath <i>my</i> pen&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>In all the plays and poems of Shakespeare, including these Sonnets,
there is no mention of any man or woman then living. The only mention
of a person then living made by our poet, either in prose or verse, is
in the dedication of the two poems to the Earl of Southampton. To
Shakespeare, to Shakespeare alone, have the Shakespearean poems and
plays been a monument; and for him have they done precisely that which
the poet says his "gentle verse" was to do for his friend; and they
have not done so in any degree for any other.</p>

<p>An anonymous writer in Chambers's <i>Edinburgh Journal</i>, in August,
1852, seems to have been one of the first to suggest the doubt as <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 51]</span>to
the authorship of the Shakespearean plays. His suggestion was that
their real author was "some pale, wasted student ... with eyes of
genius gleaming through despair" who found in Shakespeare a purchaser,
a publisher, a friend, and a patron. If that theory is correct, the
man that penned those Sonnets sleeps, as he said he would, in an
unrecorded grave, while his publisher, friend and patron, precisely as
he also said, has a place in the Pantheon of the immortals.</p>

<p>Very many of these Sonnets seem to be evolved from, or kindred to, the
thought so sharply presented in Sonnets LV. and LXXXI. I would refer
the reader particularly to Sonnets XXXVIII., XLIX., LXXI., LXXII, and
LXXXVIII. The last two lines of Sonnet LXXI. are as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lest the <i>wise</i> world should look into your moan,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And mock you with me after I am gone.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The first lines of Sonnet LXXII. are as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O! lest the world should task you to recite</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">What merit lived in me, that you should love</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 52]</span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">After my death, dear love, forget me quite,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For you in me can nothing worthy prove;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To do more for me than mine own desert,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And hang more praise upon deceased I</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than <i>niggard</i> truth would <i>willingly</i> impart:</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Many of these Sonnets, which otherwise seem entirely inexplicable, and
which have for that reason been held to be imitations or strange and
unnatural conceits, become true and genuine and much more poetic, if
we conceive them to be written, not by the accredited author of the
Shakespearean dramas, but by the unnamed and unknown student whose
connection with them was carefully concealed. I suggest that the
reader test this statement by carefully reading the four Sonnets last
mentioned.</p>

<p>The claim for a literal reading of Sonnet LXXXI. is greatly
strengthened by its context, by reading it with the group of Sonnets
of which it forms a part. Sonnets LXXVII. to XC. all more or less
relate to another poet, who, the author fears, has supplanted him in
the affection, or it may be, in the patronage of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 53]</span>his friend. That
particularly appears in Sonnet LXXXVI.:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bound for the prize of all too precious you,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was it <i>his</i> spirit, by spirits taught to write</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No, neither he, nor his compeers by night</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Giving him aid, my verse astonished.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He, nor that affable familiar ghost</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As victors, of my silence cannot boast;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I was not sick of any fear from thence:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But when your countenance fill'd up his line,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>That what is there stated as to another poet refers to an actual
transaction, and is to be read literally, is recognized, I think, by
all critics; and many have thought that the description contained in
the Sonnet quoted indicates Chapman, who translated the <i>Iliad</i> about
that time. It is in this group of Sonnets, referring to another poet,
that we find Sonnet LXXXI. The thought of the entire group is
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 54]</span>complaint, perhaps jealousy, of a rival poet; and running through them
all are allusions or statements which seem to have been intended to
strengthen the ties between him and his friend,&mdash;to hold him if he
meditated going, and to bring him back if he had already strayed. It
was obviously for that purpose that Sonnet LXXXI., one of the central
Sonnets of that group, was written; and, considered as written for
that purpose, how apt and true its language appears! The poet,
asserting that his verse is immortal, says to his friend, the
immortality it confers is yours; "your name from hence immortal life
shall have," but I shall have no share in that fame; "in me each part
will be forgotten," and "earth can yield me but a common grave."
Though the Sonnet is in the highest degree poetic, as a bare statement
of fact it is perfectly apt and appropriate to that which was the
obvious purpose of this group of Sonnets.</p>

<p>It is sometimes claimed that the author of the Shakespearean plays was
a lawyer. Certainly he was a logician and a rhetorician. The clash of
minds and of speech appearing in <i>Julius</i> <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 55]</span><i>C&aelig;sar</i>, in <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i>, in <i>Henry IV.</i>, and in many other plays, shows a most
wonderful facility for stating a case, for presenting an argument. Let
us then assume that the poet was simply stating his own case against a
rival poet, presenting his own appeal,&mdash;and the verse at once has
added dignity and passion, and we almost feel the poet's heart throb.
Of course the final question&mdash;whether or not the two Sonnets printed
at the head of this chapter were founded on the conditions and
situations they state, and whether or not they express actual feelings
and emotions&mdash;must be answered by each from a careful reading of the
Sonnets themselves. To me, however, their message of sadness,
loneliness, and implied appeal seems as clear and certain as the
portrayal of agony in the marble of Laoco&ouml;n.</p>

<p>That Sonnet LV., and perhaps in some degree Sonnet LXXXI., are moulded
after verses of Ovid or Horace, is often mentioned. And it is
mentioned as though that somehow detracted from their meaning or
force. That fact seems to me rather to reinforce that meaning. The
words of Ovid are translated as follows:</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 56]</span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now have I brought a work to an end which neither Jove's fierce wrath,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor sword nor fire nor fretting age with all the force it hath,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Are able to abolish quite.[<a href="#f22">22</a><a name="f22_22" id="f22_22"></a>]</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Ode of Horace has been translated as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A monument on stable base,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">More strong than Brass, my Name shall grace;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than Regal Pyramids more high</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which Storms and Years unnumber'd shall defy.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My nobler Part shall swiftly rise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Above this Earth, and claim the Skies.[<a href="#f23">23</a><a name="f23_23" id="f23_23"></a>]</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Agreeing that the poet had in mind the words of Ovid and of Horace and
believed that his productions would outlast bronze or marble, we see
that, so far following their thoughts, by a quick transition he says
that not he, but his friend, is to have the immortality that his
poetry will surely bring. While this comparison with the Latin poems
may not much aid an interpretation that seemed clear and certain
without it, at least its sudden rending from <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 57]</span>their thought does not
weaken, but strengthens the effect of the statement that the writer
was to have no part in the immortality of his own poetry.</p>

<p>It may be said that it is entirely improbable that the author of the
greater of the Shakespearean plays should have allowed their guerdon
of fame and immortality to pass to and remain with another. But if we
accept the results of the later criticism, we must then agree,&mdash;that
there were at least three poets who wrought in and for the
Shakespearean plays, that two of the three consented that their work
should go to the world as that of another, and that at least one of
the two was a poet of distinctive excellence. At that time the
publication and sale of books was very limited and the relative rights
of publishers and authors were such that the author had but little or
none of the pecuniary results. The theatre was the most promising and
hence the most usual market for literary work, and it seems certain
that poets and authors sold their literary productions to the managers
of theatres, retaining no title or interest in them. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 58]</span>However the poet
of the Shakespearean plays may have anticipated the verdict of
posterity, the plays bear most abundant evidence that they were
written to be acted, to entertain and please, and to bring patrons and
profit to the theatres which were in the London of three hundred years
ago.</p>

<p>Boucicault was the publisher and accredited author of one hundred and
thirty plays. But no one would deem it improbable that in them is the
work of another, or of many other dramatists.</p>

<p>I submit that the argument from probabilities is without force against
the clear and unambiguous statements of the Sonnets quoted in this
chapter.</p>

<h3>OF THE CHARACTER OF SHAKESPEARE AS RELATED TO THE CHARACTER OF THE AUTHOR
  OF THE SONNETS</h3>

<p>The Sonnets certainly reveal their author in an attitude of appeal,
more or less open and direct, for the love or favor of his friend. No
fervor of compliment or protestation of affection allows him to forget
or conceal this purpose. When, as is indicated by Sonnets LXXVII. to
XC., he feared that his friend was transferring his favor or patronage
to another poet, his anxiety became acute, and in that group he
compared not only his poetry, but his flattery and commendation with
that of his rival. In Sonnets XXXII. to XXXVII., portraying his grief
at his friend's unkindness, he hastens to forgive; and, as already
stated, in Sonnets XL. to XLIII. and CXXVII. to CLII., chiding his
friend for having accepted the love of his mistress, he crowns him
with <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 60]</span>poetic garlands of compliment and adulation. Smitten on one
cheek, not only does he turn the other, but he bestows kisses and
caresses on the hand that gave the blow.</p>

<p>All we know of the character of Shakespeare indicates that he was
neither meek and complacent, nor quick and eager in forgiving; but
that his character in those aspects was quite the reverse of the
character of the author of the Sonnets.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee states the effect or result of the various traditions as to Shakespeare's
  poaching experiences, and his resentment of the treatment he had received, as
  follows[<a href="#f24">24</a><a name="f24_24" id="f24_24"></a>]:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
  <p>'And his [Shakespeare's] sporting experiences passed at times beyond orthodox
    limits. A poaching adventure, according to a <i>credible</i>[<a href="#f25">25</a><a name="f25_25" id="f25_25"></a>]
    tradition, was the immediate cause of his long severance from his native place.
    "He had," wrote Rowe in 1709, "by a misfortune common enough to young fellows,
    fallen into ill company, and among them, some, that made a frequent practice
    of deer-stealing, engaged <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 61]</span>him with them more than once in robbing a park that
    belonged to Sir Thomas Lucy of Charlecote near Stratford. For this he was
    prosecuted by that gentleman, <i>as he thought, somewhat too severely</i>;
    and, <i>in order to revenge</i> that ill-usage, he made a ballad upon him,
    and though this, probably the first essay of his poetry, be lost, <i>yet it
    is said to have been so very bitter</i> that it redoubled the prosecution
    against him to that degree that he was obliged to leave his business and family
    in Warwickshire and shelter himself in London." The independent testimony
    of Archdeacon Davies, who was vicar of Saperton, Gloucestershire, late in
    the seventeenth century, is to the effect that Shakespeare "was much given
    to all unluckiness in stealing venison and rabbits, particularly from Sir
    Thomas Lucy, who had him oft whipt, and sometimes imprisoned, and at last
    made him fly his native county to his great advancement." The law of Shakespeare's
    day (5 Eliz., cap. 21) punished deer-stealers with three months' imprisonment
    and the payment of thrice the amount of the damage done.</p>

<p>The tradition has been challenged on the ground that the
Charlecote deer-park was of later date than the sixteenth
century. But Sir Thomas Lucy was an extensive game-preserver, and
owned at Charlecote a warren in <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 62]</span>which a few harts or does
doubtless found an occasional home. Samuel Ireland was informed
in 1794 that Shakespeare stole the deer, not from Charlecote, but
from Fulbroke Park, a few miles off, and Ireland supplied in his
<i>Views on the Warwickshire Avon</i>, 1795, an engraving of an old
farmhouse in the hamlet of Fulbroke, where he asserted that
Shakespeare was temporarily imprisoned after his arrest. An
adjoining hovel was locally known for some years as Shakespeare's
"deer-barn," but no portion of Fulbroke Park, which included the
site of these buildings (now removed), was Lucy's property in
Elizabeth's reign, and the amended legend, which was solemnly
confided to Sir Walter Scott in 1828 by the owner of Charlecote,
seems pure invention.</p>  <p>The ballad which Shakespeare is reported to have fastened on the park gates
    of Charlecote, does not, as Rowe acknowledged, survive. No authenticity can
    be allowed the worthless lines beginning, "A parliament member, a justice
    of peace," which were represented to be Shakespeare's on the authority of
    an old man who lived near Stratford and died in 1703. But <i>such an incident
    as the tradition reveals has left a distinct impress on Shakespearean drama.
    Justice Shallow is beyond doubt a</i> <span class='pagenum'><a name="page_63" id="page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span><i>reminiscence of the owner of Charlecote.</i>[<a href="#f26">26</a><a name="f26_26" id="f26_26"></a>]
    According to Archdeacon Davies of Saperton, Shakespeare's "<i>revenge</i>
    was so great" that he caricatured Lucy as "Justice Clodpate," who was (Davies
    adds) represented on the stage as "a great man" and as bearing, in allusion
    to Lucy's name, "three louses rampant for his arms." Justice Shallow, Davies's
    "Justice Clodpate," came to birth in the Second Part of <i>Henry IV.</i> (1598),
    and he is represented in the opening scene of the <i>Merry Wives of Windsor</i>
    as having come from Gloucestershire to Windsor to make a Star-Chamber matter
    of a poaching raid on his estate. The "three luces hauriant argent" were the
    arms borne by the Charlecote Lucys, and the dramatist's prolonged reference
    in this scene to the "dozen white luces" on Justice Shallow's "old coat" fully
    establishes Shallow's identity with Lucy.</p>

<p>The poaching episode is best assigned to 1585, but it may be
questioned whether Shakespeare, on fleeing from Lucy's
persecution, at once sought an asylum in London.'</p></div>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 64]</span></p>
<p>Halliwell gives the following traditions of Shakespeare's sharp encounters
  or exchanges of wit[<a href="#f27">27</a><a name="f27_27" id="f27_27"></a>]:</p>

<p>Mr. Ben Jonson and Mr. Wm. Shakespeare being merry at a tavern, Mr.
Jonson having begun this for his epitaph,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here lies Ben Jonson, that was once one,</span><br />
</p>

<p>he gives it to Mr. Shakespeare to make up, who presently writes,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who while he lived was a slow thing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And now being dead is nothing.</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Another version is:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Here lies Jonson,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who was one's son</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He had a little hair on his chin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His name was Benjamin!</span><br />
</p>

<p>an amusing allusion to his personal appearance, as any one may see who
will turn to Ben's portrait.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Jonson.</i> If but stage actors all the world displays</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where shall we find spectators of their plays?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Shakespeare.</i> Little or much of what we see we do;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We are all both actors and spectators too.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 65]</span>Ten in the hundred lies here ingrav'd;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'Tis a hundred to ten his soul is not saved;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If any man ask, Who lies in this tomb?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! oh! quoth the devil, 'tis my John-a-Combe.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who lies in this tomb?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hough, quoth the devil, 'tis my son, John-Combe.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The tradition is that the subject of the last six lines having died,
Shakespeare then composed an epitaph as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Howe'er he lived, judge not,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">John Combe shall never be forgot,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While poor hath memory, for he did gather</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To make the poor his issue; he their father,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As record of his tilth and seed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Did crown him, in his latter need.</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is said to have been composed of a brother of John-a-Combe:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thin in beard, and thick in purse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Never man beloved worse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He went to the grave with many a curse,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The devil and he had both one nurse.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>A blacksmith is said to have accosted Shakespeare with,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now, Mr. Shakespeare, tell me, if you can,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The difference between a youth and a young man?</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 66]</span></p>
<p>To which the poet immediately replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou son of fire, with thy face like a maple,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The same difference as between a scalded and a coddled apple.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>An old tradition reports that being awakened after a prolonged
carouse, and asked to renew the contest, he refused, saying, I have
drunk with</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Piping Pebworth, Dancing Marston,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Haunted Hillborough, and Hungry Grafton</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With Dadging Exhall, Papist Wixford</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beggarly Broom, and Drunken Bidford.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The lines inscribed on the slab above his grave, preventing the
removal of his bones, according to the custom of that time, to the
adjacent charnel-house, are as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbeare</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To dig the dust enclosed heare;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bleste be the man that spare these stones,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And curst be he that moves my bones.[<a href="#f28">28</a><a name="f28_28" id="f28_28"></a>]</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Mr. Lee gives a statement as to Shakespeare's propensity to litigation as follows[<a href="#f29">29</a><a name="f29_29" id="f29_29"></a>]:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 67]</span>'As early as 1598 Abraham Sturley had suggested that Shakespeare
should purchase the tithes of Stratford. Seven years later, on
July 24, 1605, he bought for &pound;440 of Ralph Huband an unexpired
term of thirty-one years of a ninety-two years' lease of a moiety
of the tithes of Stratford, Old Stratford, Bishopton, and
Welcombe. The moiety was subject to a rent of &pound;17 to the
Corporation, who were the reversionary owners on the lease's
expiration, and of &pound;5 to John Barker, the heir of a former
proprietor. The investment brought Shakespeare, under the most
favorable circumstances, no more than an annuity of &pound;38; and the
refusal of persons who claimed an interest in the other moiety to
acknowledge the full extent of their liability to the Corporation
led that body to demand from the poet payments justly due from
others. After 1609 he joined with two interested persons, Richard
Lane of Awston, and Thomas Greene, the town clerk of Stratford,
in a suit in Chancery to determine the exact responsibilities of
all the tithe-owners, and in 1612 they presented a bill of
complaint to Lord Chancellor Ellesmere, with what result is
unknown. His acquisition of a part ownership in the tithes was
fruitful in legal embarrassments.</p>

  <p><i>Shakespeare inherited his father's love of liti</i><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 68]</span><i>gation, and stood rigorously
    by his rights in all his business relations.</i> In March, 1600, he recovered
    in London a debt of &pound;7 from one John Clayton. In July, 1604, in the
    local court at Stratford, he sued one Philip Rogers, to whom he had supplied
    since the preceding March malt to the value of &pound;1 19<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>,
    and had on June 25th lent 2<i>s.</i> in cash. Rogers paid back 6<i>s.</i>,
    and Shakespeare sought the balance of the account, &pound;1 15<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>
    During 1608 and 1609 he was at law with another fellow-townsman, John Addenbroke.
    On February 15, 1609, Shakespeare, who was apparently represented by his solicitor
    and kinsman, Thomas Greene, obtained judgment from a jury against Addenbroke
    for the payment of &pound;6 and &pound;1 5<i>s.</i> costs, but Addenbroke
    left the town, and the triumph proved barren. Shakespeare avenged himself
    by proceeding against one Thomas Horneby, who had acted as the absconding
    debtor's bail.'</p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The same author gives the following statement as to his reputation for <i>sportive
  adventure</i>[<a href="#f30">30</a><a name="f30_30" id="f30_30"></a>]:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Hamlet, Othello, and Lear were <i>r&ocirc;les</i> in which he [Burbage]
gained especial renown. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 69]</span>But Burbage and Shakespeare were popularly
credited with co-operation in less solemn enterprises. They were
reputed to be companions in many <i>sportive</i> adventures. The sole
anecdote of Shakespeare that is <i>positively known to have been
recorded in his lifetime</i> relates that Burbage, when playing Richard
III., agreed with a lady in the audience to visit her after the
performance; Shakespeare, overhearing the conversation,
anticipated the actor's visit and met Burbage on his arrival with
the quip that "William the Conqueror was before Richard the
Third."</p>

<p>Such gossip possibly deserves little more acceptance than the
later story, in the same key, which credits Shakespeare with the
paternity of Sir William D'Avenant. The latter was baptized at
Oxford, on March 3, 1605, as the son of John D'Avenant, the
landlord of the Crown Inn, where Shakespeare lodged in his
journeys to and from Stratford. The story of Shakespeare's
parental relation to D'Avenant was long current in Oxford, and
was at times complacently accepted by the reputed son.
Shakespeare is known to have been a welcome guest at John
D'Avenant's house, and another son, Robert, boasted of the kindly
notice which the poet took of him as a child. It is safer to
adopt the less compromising version which <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 70]</span>makes Shakespeare the
godfather of the boy William instead of his father. <i>But the
antiquity and persistence of the scandal belie the assumption
that Shakespeare was known to his contemporaries as a man of
scrupulous virtue.</i>'</p></div>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>All the extracts I have here quoted are from writers who admit no
question as to the authorship of the Shakespearean plays. And there is
nothing which they or any biography or tradition bring to us which
presents any act or characteristic at all at variance with the
indications of these quotations. And it is very remarkable how strong
is the concurrence of indications, from the slab above his grave, from
old, musty, and otherwise forgotten records of court proceedings, and
from traditions, whether from the hamlet of his birth or the city
where he wrought and succeeded.</p>

<p>I have not quoted the lines which have been variously handed down as those
  which the young Shakespeare affixed to the gate of the wealthy and powerful
  Sir Thomas Lucy. Their authenticity is doubtful.[<a href="#f31">31</a><a name="f31_31" id="f31_31"></a>] But
  that the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 71]</span>boy Shakespeare, weak and helpless for such a struggle, resented his
  treatment and answered back with the only weapon he had, risking and enduring
  being driven from his home and birthplace, and kept good the grudge in the days
  of his success, I think cannot be doubted. The records of court proceedings,
  the imprecation above his grave, both indicate a man of strong will and not
  unaccustomed to mastery. We may reject one or another of the retorts or sallies
  in verse, but we must, I think, agree, that the fact that they are brought to
  us by recorded and very old traditions, indicates a character or repute in accordance
  with their implication; and especially must this be so, when we find that they
  agree with the indications of other evidence not in any degree in question.
  These various indications support each other like the bundle of sticks which
  together could not be broken. From them I think we learn that Shakespeare, however
  pleasant or attractive at times, was not a man yielding or complacent to opposition
  or injury; but that he was a man of fighting blood or instincts, quick in wit
  and repartee, apt and <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 72]</span>inclined for aggressive sally, ready to slash and lay
  about him in all encounters,&mdash;in short, a very Mercutio in temperament,
  and in the lively and constant challenges of his life.</p>

<p>I submit that the records we have of the life of William Shakespeare
concur in indicating a man who could not have written the Sonnets
under the circumstances and with the motives which they reveal.</p>

<p>It should not be overlooked that at the time these Sonnets were written, certainly
  as early as 1597 or 1598, Shakespeare was above pecuniary want, and had begun
  to make investments, and apparently regarded himself and was regarded as a wealthy
  man.[<a href="#f32">32</a><a name="f32_32" id="f32_32"></a>]</p>

<h3>OF THE GENERAL SCOPE AND EFFECT OF THE SONNETS AS INDICATING THEIR AUTHOR</h3>

<p>As has been said before, the Sonnets obviously have a common theme.
They celebrate his friend, his beauty, his winning and lovable
qualities, leading the poet to forgive and to continue to love, even
when his friend has supplanted him in the favors of his mistress. They
are replete with compliment and adulation. Little side views or
perspectives are introduced with a marvellous facility of invention;
and yet in them all, even in the invocation to marry, in the jealousy
of another poet, in the railing to or of his false mistress, is the
face or thought of his friend, apparently his patron. No other poet,
it seems to me, could have filled two thousand lines of poetry with
thoughts to, of, or relating to one person of his own sex. Who that
person was critics <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 74]</span>have not agreed. But that he was a person who was
somehow connected with the life-work of the poet seems beyond
dispute.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee, speaking of the purpose of the Sonnets, at pages 125 and 126,
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>'Twenty Sonnets, which may for purposes of exposition be entitled
"dedicatory" Sonnets, are addressed to one who is declared
without periphrasis and without disguise to be a patron of the
poet's verse (Nos. XXIII., XXVI., XXXII., XXXVII., XXXVIII.,
LXIX., LXXVII.-LXXXVI., C., CI., CIII., CVI.). In one of
these,&mdash;Sonnet LXXVIII.,&mdash;Shakespeare asserted:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And found such fair assistance in my verse</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As every alien pen hath got my use</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And <i>under thee their poesy disperse</i>.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Subsequently he regretfully pointed out how his patron's
readiness to accept the homage of other poets seemed to be
thrusting him from the enviable place of pre-eminence in his
patron's esteem.</p>

<p>Shakespeare's biographer is under an obligation to attempt an
identification of the persons whose relations with the poet are
defined so <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 75]</span>explicitly. The problem presented by the patron is
simple. Shakespeare states unequivocally that he has no patron
but one.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sing [sc. O Muse!] to the ear that doth thy lays esteem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And gives thy pen both skill and argument (C. 7-8).</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For to no other pass my verses tend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than of your <i>graces and your gifts to tell</i> (CIII. 11-12).</span><br />
</p>

<p>The Earl of Southampton, the patron of his narrative poems, is
the only patron of Shakespeare that is known to biographical
research. No contemporary document or tradition gives the
faintest suggestion that Shakespeare was the friend or dependent
of any other man of rank.'</p></div>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>This quotation has been made because it is fair and accurate, because
of the high authority of the book, but principally because it is the
view of one who has no doubt that Shakespeare was the author of the
Shakespearean plays. Research and ingenuity have been taxed to
ascertain who was the unnamed and mysterious friend at whose feet are
laid so many poetic wreaths, woven by such a master. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 76]</span>All discussion
has assumed that this friend was a patron, who somehow greatly aided
the poet, and to whom the poet felt himself greatly indebted. And so
it was at once suggested that his friend was one of the nobility or
peers of that age.</p>

<p>The Earl of Southampton (to whom by name <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and
<i>Lucrece</i> were dedicated) has been very generally assumed to be the
person intended. Lord Pembroke [William Herbert] has also been
presented as the unnamed friend.</p>

<p><i>I think the Sonnets contain internal evidence that they were not
addressed to either of these peers</i>, <span class="smcap">and were not addressed to any one
of their class</span>.</p>

<p>It is very remarkable how narrow is the range of these Sonnets,&mdash;how little
  they say, convey or indicate as to the person to whom they were addressed. From
  the first seventeen Sonnets we infer that the poet understood that his friend
  was unmarried; a line in Sonnet III. perhaps indicates a peculiar pride in his
  mother, and that it pleased him to be told that he resembled her; from a line
  in Sonnet XX., "A <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 77]</span>man in hue," etc., it has been inferred that his friend's
  beard or hair was auburn, and from Sonnets CXXXV. and CXXXVI. it has been inferred
  that his friend was familiarly called "Will," or at any rate that his name was
  William. Obviously he was in some way a patron or helper to our poet, and to
  another poet as well[<a href="#f33">33</a><a name="f33_33" id="f33_33"></a>]; he superseded the poet in the favors
  of his mistress; he was beautiful, attractive, genial, and sunny in disposition;
  that he was not infrequently responsive to lascivious love is indicated.[<a href="#f34">34</a><a name="f34_34" id="f34_34"></a>]
  We have already fully considered what the Sonnets indicate as to his age. And
  now I put the inquiry: Is there anything else as to the poet's friend that these
  two thousand lines of poetry state or indicate? With diligent search I can find
  in all those lines no other fact indicated or stated as to this mysterious friend
  or patron.</p>

<p>In Sonnet CXXIV. the poet says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If <i>my dear love were but</i> the child of state,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd.</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 78]</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From that it has been argued that his friend was of the nobility, a
"child of state."</p>

<p>Reading those two lines, or reading the entire Sonnet, it seems clear
that if they contain any indication as to the station of his friend,
the indication is rather against than in favor of his being of the
nobility, "a child of state."</p>

<p>I do not think, however, that the lines allow any clear or certain
deduction either way, but have called attention to them because they
are often cited on this point.</p>

<p>In Sonnet XIII. occurs the line,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who lets so fair a <i>house</i> fall to decay.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The word "house" as there used has been interpreted as though used in
the sense of the House of York, and so made an implication that his
friend was of a lordly line. Such a far-fetched and unusual
interpretation should not be adopted unless clearly indicated. And the
context clearly indicates that the phrase "so fair a house" is used as
a metaphor for the poet's fair and beautiful body. If this inquiry
were to be affected by far-drawn or even doubtful interpretations, I
might quote from <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 79]</span>Sonnet LXXXVI. There the poet, referring to his
rival, says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But when your <i>countenance</i> fill'd up his line.</span><br />
</p>

<p>By merely limiting the word <i>countenance</i> to its primary meaning, we may
  have the inference that his rival's verse was spoken or <i>acted</i> by his
  friend, and so that his friend was an actor. I do not think, however, that either
  of the two lines last cited are entitled to any weight as argument, but they
  illustrate the distinction between lines or Sonnets which may be the basis of
  surmise or conjecture, and those elsewhere cited, to which two different effects
  cannot be given without rending their words from their natural meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>The Earl of Southampton was born in 1573. He bore an historic name; fields,
  forests, and castles were his and had come to him from his ancestors; all of
  England that was most beautiful or most attractive was in the circle in which
  he moved and to which his presence contributed. In 1595 he appeared in the lists
  at a tournament in honor of the Queen; in 1596 and 1597 he joined in dangerous
  and suc<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 80]</span>cessful naval and military expeditions; in 1598 he was married.[<a href="#f35">35</a><a name="f35_35" id="f35_35"></a>]
  Is it conceivable that two thousand lines of adulatory poetry could have been
  written to and of him, and no hint appear of incidents like these? It is simply
  incredible. What is omitted rather than what is said clearly indicates that
  the life of the poet's friend presented no such incidents,&mdash;indeed no incidents
  which the poet chronicler of court and camp would interweave in his garlands
  of loving compliment.</p>

<p>Urging his friend to marry, the poet, comparing the harmony of music
to a happy marriage, in Sonnet VIII. says:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Resembling sire and child and happy mother,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sings this to thee: "Thou single wilt prove none."</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>But is it not a little strange that the pen that drew Rosalind and
Juliet should have gone no farther, when by a touch he could have
filled it with suggestions of the fair, the <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 81]</span>stately and the titled maidens
who were in the court life of that day, and whose names and faces and
reputed characters must have been known to the poet, whatever his place or
station in London? How would a tracing of a mother, nobly born, or of a
lordly but deceased father, of some old castle, of some fair eminence, of
some grand forest, or of ancestral oaks shading fair waters, have lightened
the picture! And could the poet who gave us the magnificent pictures of
English kings and queens, princes and lords&mdash;could that poet, writing to
and of one of the fairest of the courtly circle of the reign of Elizabeth,
so withhold his pen that it gives no hint that his friend was in or of
that circle, or any suggestion of his most happy and fortunate
surroundings? Surely, in painting so fully the beauties of his friend,
the poet would have allowed to appear some hint of the beauty of light
and color in which he moved.</p>

<p>I have before me in the book of Mr. Lee, a copy of the picture of the
Earl of Southampton painted in Welbeck Abbey. The dress is of the
court; and the sword, the armor, the plume <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 82]</span>and rich drapery all
indicate a member of the nobility. Could our great poet in so many
lines of extreme compliment and adulation have always omitted any
reference to the insignia of rank which were almost a part of the
young Earl; and would he always have escaped all reference to coronet
or sword, to lands or halls, or to any of the employments or sports,
privileges or honors, then much more than now, distinctive of a peer
of the realm?</p>

<p>And all that is here said equally repels the inference that these Sonnets were
  addressed to any person connected with the nobility. The claim that they were
  addressed to Lord Pembroke [William Herbert] I think is exploded, if it ever
  had substance.[<a href="#f36">36</a><a name="f36_36" id="f36_36"></a>] Lord Pembroke did not come to London until
  1598 and was then but eighteen years old. There is not a particle of evidence
  that he and Shakespeare had any relations or intimacy whatever.</p>

<p>While I regard the view that the Sonnets were addressed to Southampton
as entirely untenable, it nevertheless has this basis,&mdash;two of the
Shakespearean poems were dedi<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 83]</span>
cated to Southampton. At least we may say that, if they were addressed to any
person of that class, there is a strong probability in his favor. And in order
to consider that claim I would ask the reader to turn back to Sonnet II., <a href="#Page_23">page
23</a>. That certainly is one of the very earliest of the Sonnets, almost certainly
written when Shakespeare was not older than thirty and Southampton not over twenty-one
years of age. With these facts in mind, the assumption that those lines were addressed
to the Earl of Southampton becomes altogether improbable. Can we imagine a man
of thirty, in the full glow of a vigorous and successful life, saying to a friend
of twenty-one,&mdash;you should marry now, because when you are <i>forty years</i>
old (about twice your present age and ten years above my own) your beauty will
have faded and your blood be cold?</p>
<p>We should not so slander the author of the Shakespearean plays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>The language of the Sonnets implies a familiarity and equality of intercourse
  not consistent with the theory that they were addressed <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 84]</span>to a peer of England
  by a person in Shakespeare's position.[<a href="#f37">37</a><a name="f37_37" id="f37_37"></a>]</p>

<p>The dedication of <i>Lucrece</i>, which apparently was written in 1593, omits
  no reference to title, and envinces no disposition or privilege to ignore the
  rank or dignities of the Earl. I will quote no particular Sonnet on this point;
  but the impression which the entire series seems to me to convey, is that the
  poet was addressing a friend separated from him by no distinction of rank. Sonnets
  XCVI. and XCVII. are instances of such familiarity of address and communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>On the other hand, there is not a single indication which the Sonnets contain
  as to the poet's friend which in any manner disagrees with what we know of Shakespeare.
  It may be said that being married the invocation to marry could not have been
  addressed to him. <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 85]</span>But the test is,&mdash;how did he pass, how was he known in
  London, as married or unmarried? He is supposed to have come to London in 1586,
  or when he was twenty-two years of age, and he was then married and had three
  children. He remained in London about twenty-five years, and there is no indication
  that any member of his family ever resided there or visited him, and the clear
  consensus of opinion seems to be that they did not.[<a href="#f38">38</a><a name="f38_38" id="f38_38"></a>] The
  indications that he had little love for his wife are regrettably clear.[<a href="#f39">39</a><a name="f39_39" id="f39_39"></a>]
  When the earlier Sonnets were written he must have been living there about nine
  years, and must have had an income sufficient easily to have maintained his
  family in the city.[<a href="#f40">40</a><a name="f40_40" id="f40_40"></a>] That he led a life notoriously free
  as to women cannot be questioned. Traditions elsewhere referred to so indicate[<a href="#f41">41</a><a name="f41_41" id="f41_41"></a>];
  and whether the Sonnets were written by or to him they equally so testify. Under
  such cir<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 86]</span>cumstances his friends or acquaintances would not be led to presume
  that he was married, but would assume the contrary. They would have done or
  considered precisely as we do, classing our friends as married or unmarried,
  as their mode of life indicates. Hence the invocation to marry is entirely consistent
  with the theory that the Sonnets were addressed to Shakespeare. When Sonnet
  CIV. was written, the poet had known his friend but three years[<a href="#f42">42</a><a name="f42_42" id="f42_42"></a>];
  the Sonnets referring to marriage are printed first, and very probably were
  written much earlier than Sonnet CIV., and perhaps when their acquaintance was
  first formed. The fact that the appeal ceases with the seventeenth Sonnet, and
  that after that there is not even a hint of marrying, or of female excellence
  and beauty, perhaps indicates that the first seventeen Sonnets had provoked
  a disclosure which restrained the poet from further reference to those subjects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>The starting point in this chapter is the fact stated by Mr. Lee, and
I think conceded or as<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 87]</span>sumed by all writers on these Sonnets,&mdash;that
they were written to some one intimately connected with the
Shakespearean plays, either as a patron or in some other manner. Many,
perhaps all, of the plays were produced, and in that way published, at
the theatre where Shakespeare acted. Those of the higher class or
order as well as those of the lower class were published as his. Those
most strenuous in supporting the claims of authorship for Shakespeare,
have, I think, generally conceded that the plays, as we now have them,
reveal in various parts the work of more than one author. And from
that it has been suggested that Shakespeare must have had a
fellow-worker,&mdash;a collaborator. Lee's <i>Shakespeare</i>, Brandes's
<i>Critical Study of Shakespeare</i>, and the Temple edition of
Shakespeare's works, are practically agreed on this fact in relation
to <i>Henry VI.</i>, <i>Henry VIII.</i>, <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and some other
plays. There must have been a very considerable degree of intercourse
between the two persons who worked together even on a single one of
these plays. And there are Sonnets which at least suggest a <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 88]</span>degree
and kind of intercourse and communication between the poet and his
friend which such a relation would require.</p>

<p>Chiding his friend for absence in Sonnets LVII. and LVIII., the poet
indicates such waiting and watching as would come to him had their
relations been very intimate, and perhaps indicates that he and his
friend lodged together.</p>

<p>Those Sonnets are as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Being your slave, what should I do but tend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Upon the <i>hours</i> and times of your desire?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I have no precious time at all to spend,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor <i>services</i> to do, <i>till you require</i>.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor dare I chide the <i>world-without-end hour</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whilst I, my sovereign, <i>watch the clock for you</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor think the bitterness of absence sour</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When you have bid your servant once adieu;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor dare I question with my jealous thought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Where you may be</i>, or your affairs suppose,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But, <i>like a sad slave, stay</i> and think of nought</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Save, <i>where you are how happy</i> you make those.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So true a fool is love that in your will,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Though you do anything, he thinks no ill.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That God forbid that made me first your slave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I should <i>in thought control your times of pleasure</i>,</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 89]</span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or at your hand the account of <i>hours</i> to crave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Being your vassal, <i>bound to stay your leisure</i>!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O, let me suffer, being at your beck,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The imprison'd absence of your liberty;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each check,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Without accusing you of injury.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Be where you list, your charter is so strong</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That <i>you yourself may privilege your time</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>To what you will</i>; to you it doth belong</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I am to <i>wait</i>, though waiting so be hell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Not <i>blame your pleasure</i>, be it ill or well.</span><br />
</p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am not unaware that there are other Sonnets which indicate that they
lived apart, though it is of course quite possible that they lived
apart at one time and together at another. But whether or not they at
any time lodged together, these Sonnets indicate that their lives were
brought together by some common purpose, and that hours and seasons of
communication and perhaps of kindred labor were frequent to them. Our
affections or friendships do not blossom in untilled fields; it is the
comradeship of common effort, mutually helpful and beneficial, that
more than often determines the impalpable garments <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 90]</span>and coverings of
our lives. Certainly we may believe that the two characters that fill
these two thousand lines of poetry did not live and move so far apart
as were the busy actor at a theatre and the courted and adventurous
peer of England.</p>

<p>If the friend to whom the Sonnets were addressed was Shakespeare, and
if the author of the Sonnets and of the accredited Shakespearean plays
was some "pale, wasted," and unknown student who sold his labors and
his genius to another, we may perhaps see how they would have had
frequent interviews and hours of labor, and how Shakespeare might have
had all the relations to the poet, which the Sonnets imply of the
poet's friend. But if Shakespeare, then well advanced both to fame and
fortune, was the poet it is very difficult to imagine any one person
who could have borne to him all the relations which the Sonnets
indicate&mdash;patron or benefactor and familiar associate and companion; a
rival and successor in the favors of his mistress, and a loved or at
least cherished friend.</p>

<p>While I present the view that some unknown <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 91]</span>student wrote, and Shakespeare adopted
  and published, the Shakespearean plays, I do not deny to Shakespeare a part,
  perhaps a large part, in their production. As I have said, there are many plays
  attributed to Shakespeare, some or the greater portions of which are distinctively
  of a lower class than the greater plays or the Sonnets. The theory of collaboration
  affects at least six plays commonly classed as Shakespearean, and perhaps others
  classed as doubtful plays. Why is not the situation satisfied if we ascribe
  to Shakespeare a capacity equal to the composition of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>?
  That is a play which seems to have been attractive from its plot and the character
  of its incidents. In it, however, there are but few lines that seem to be from
  the same author as the Sonnets and the greater of the recognized Shakespearean
  plays. The remainder of the play has no poetic merit which raises it far above
  the rustic poetry which is handed down by tradition as Shakespeare's. And if
  we give the unknown student all credit for authorship of the finer poetry of
  the greater dramas, may we not still assume that Shakespeare labored <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 92]</span>with him,
  assisting in moulding into form adapted to the stage the poetry that burst from
  his friend with volcanic force; or that he perhaps sometimes suggested the side
  lights and sudden transitions which appear so often,&mdash;for instance, in
  the grave scene in <i>Hamlet</i> or the nurse's part in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>?[<a href="#f43">43</a><a name="f43_43" id="f43_43"></a>]
  And if some great unknown was the sole author and Shakespeare was the publisher
  and was to take part in the representation of these plays, may we not still,
  however they lodged, find ample occasion for the waiting hours of the poet,
  which would be entirely unexplained if the person addressed was the Earl of
  Southampton or some other member of the nobility?</p>

<p>Such a view explains very much which is otherwise inexplicable. If into that
  series of publications came the genius of the unknown author of the Sonnets,
  touching some of the plays like stray sunbeams, and as the work <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 93]</span>progressed absorbing
  and filling all their framework,&mdash;it must yet be assumed that he did not
  labor without recompense. And so we may believe that Shakespeare from friend
  became patron, and that this employment, coming as the poet was passing to life's
  "steepy night," gave him the means and the leisure for those dreams of lovers,
  of captains and of kings, so visioned on his brain that he wrote of them as
  of persons real and living. So regarding the author of the Sonnets, we appreciate
  his jealousy, when (as perhaps in <i>Henry VIII.</i>) another and almost equal
  poet was employed, and may understand how he could blame his false mistress
  and yet forgive his friend. His poetry and the opportunity and leisure for its
  enjoyment was his real mistress, like the love of Andromache for Hector displacing
  and absorbing all other loves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<p>If the Sonnets were written by Shakespeare, who the friend and patron so intimately
  related to the poet and his work was, is a riddle still unsolved; but if they
  were written by some unknown poet, the obvious and reason<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 94]</span>able inference is that
  they were addressed to Shakespeare.[<a href="#f44">44</a><a name="f44_44" id="f44_44"></a>]</p>

<p>It may be asked why I would leave anything as the work of Shakespeare,
if I deny to him the authorship of the greater plays. My answer is
this: I believe he did not write the Sonnets; and if the Sonnets are
the work of <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 95]</span>another, I think it fairly follows that the great dramas,
considered as mere poetry, are so clearly in the same class as the
Sonnets, that we must ascribe the authorship of the greater
Shakespearean dramas to the same great unknown.</p>

<p>When it is once agreed that any considerable portions of the plays
credited to Shakespeare are from different authors, almost the entire
force of the argument resting on report or tradition is destroyed;
because report or tradition is about equally satisfied and equally
antagonized by ascribing to him the authorship of either section into
which the admission of dual authorship concedes that they are divided.</p>

<p>That Shakespeare must have had a genius for dramatic work,&mdash;though not
necessarily for poetry,&mdash;his success as a reputed dramatist and as a
manager, all his history and traditions, very clearly indicate. And
conceding him that, why is not the situation fully satisfied by
considering that he was the lesser, or one of the lesser, rather than
the greater of the collaborators; and that his knowledge of the stage
and his talent for conceiving proper dramatic effects <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 96]</span>or situations,
made his labors valuable to the greater poet, aiding him to give to
his works a dramatic form and movement which many other great poets
have entirely failed to attain. So considering, the Shakespearean
plays will in some degree still seem to us the work of the gentle
Shakespeare, although in large part the product of the older and more
mature mind, the dreaming and loving recluse and student, who could
say,&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Your name</i> from hence immortal life shall have,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though <i>I</i>, once gone, to all the world must die:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The earth can yield <i>me</i> but a common grave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When <i>you</i> entombed in men's eyes shall lie.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And so believing, may we not still go with reverent feet to that grave
upon the Avon? For there, as I conceive, sleeps he whose sunny graces
won the undying love of the greatest of lovers and of poets, and whose
assistance and support made possible the dreaming hours and days in
which were delivered from his loving friend's overburdened brain the
marvellous and matchless creations of the Shakespearean anthology.</p>

  Robert Arden, gentleman. The grant gave the father the title of Esquire and

<p>[<a href="#f43_43">43</a>]<a name="f43" id="f43"></a> These plays contain names of places and persons,
  and allusions and references, which could hardly have been made had Shakespeare
  been a stranger to their composition. In <i>As You Like It</i>, the forest has
  his mother's family name, "Arden"; the allusion to Sir Thomas Lucy, has already
  been noticed. <a href="#page_63">Page 63</a>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p>[<a href="#f44_44">44</a>]<a name="f44" id="f44"></a> While I speak of the poet of the Sonnets and
  of the greater plays as unknown, I can but believe that the Sonnets, when carefully
  studied in connection with contemporaneous history and chronicles, will yet
  afford an adequate clew to his identification. It occurs to me that a promising
  line of inquiry might be made on this assumption,&mdash;that the poet was born
  about twenty years before Shakespeare and died soon after the production of
  the plays ceased, or when about sixty-five or seventy years of age; that he
  had reverses and disappointments, perhaps humiliations; that his name was William,
  and that he had written other works before he wrote the Shakespearean plays.
  It is also possible, although I think not probable, that the initials, W. H.,
  appearing in the introduction to these Sonnets may refer to him. That he had
  produced earlier works, I think is shown by Sonnet LXXVI. The first lines of
  that Sonnet are as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Why is my verse so barren of new pride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So far from variation of quick change?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Why with the time do I not glance aside</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To new-found methods and to compounds strange?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Why write I still all one, ever the same,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>And keep inventions in a noted weed,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>That every word doth almost tell my name</i>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Showing their birth and where they did proceed?"</span><br />

<h3>OF THE CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN FROM THE SONNETS</h3>

<p>The result of the preceding discussion, as it appears to me, is as
follows:</p>

<p>The Sonnets were not written by Shakespeare, but it is very probable
that he was the friend or patron around whom their poetry moves and to
whom most of them are addressed.</p>

<p>Reading the entire series with that theory in mind, very many
difficulties of interpretation are entirely overcome. Without this
theory so many of the Sonnets seem blind, or obviously false or
inaccurate, that many have been led to the inference of conceits,
affectations, imitations, or hidden meanings. Adopting the theory here
presented, there is neither reason nor excuse for giving to their
words any other than their natural or ordinary meaning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 98]</span>I would not deny to Shakespeare great talent. His success in and with
theatres certainly forbids us to do so. That he had a bent or a talent
for rhyming or for poetry, an early and persistent tradition and the
inscription over his grave indicate. And otherwise there could hardly
have been attributed to him so many plays beside those written by the
author of the Sonnets.</p>

<p>Assuming that the Sonnets were not written by him, it would then seem
clear that to Shakespeare, working as an actor, adapter or perhaps
author, came a very great poet, one who outclassed all the writers of
that day, in some respects all other writers; and that it is the
poetry of that great unknown which, flowing into Shakespeare's work,
comprises all, or nearly all of it which the world treasures or cares
to remember. I would not dispute any claim made for Shakespeare for
dramatic as distinguished from poetic talent, for wit, or comely or
captivating graces. The case is all with him there,&mdash;at least there is
no evidence to the contrary. But I insist that the Sonnets reveal
another poet, and reveal that those great <span class='pagenum'>[Pg 99]</span>dramas, or at least that
those portions of them which are in the same class or grade of poetry
as the Sonnets, were the work of that great unknown.</p>

<h2><a name="appendix" id="appendix"></a>APPENDIX</h2>


<p>The different versions of the verses which Shakespeare is alleged to have composed
  on Sir Thomas Lucy are as follows:</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;">A parliamente member, a justice of peace,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">At home a poore scare-crow, at London an asse;</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">If lowsie is Lucy, as some volke miscalle it,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then Lucy is lowsie, whatever befalle it:</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">He thinkes himselfe greate,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Yet an asse in his state</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">We allowe by his eares but with asses to mate.</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">If Lucy is lowsie, as some volke miscalle it,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sing lowsie Lucy, whatever befalle it.</span><br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sir Thomas was too covetous</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">To covet so much deer,</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">When horns enough upon his head</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Most plainly did appear.</span><br />
  <br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Had not his worship one deer left?</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">What then? He had a wife</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Took pains enough to find him horns</span><br />
  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">Should last him during life.</span></p>
